# SQL-Challenge

# Data Modeling
Data modeling for the project was done with the creation of the ERD diagram. This is under sql-challenge-ERD-diagram.PNG.
The relationships between these tables facilitated by foreign and primary keys are critical for putting the resulting tables together.

# Data Engineering
The creation of tables using the ERD guidelines allows us to use these tables as tools for our following analysis. This is under sql_challenge_data_engineering.sql.

# Data Analysis
Using the tables we just created in engineering, we can facilitate proper analysis of the data using functions like JOINS and ORDER BYs. This allows us to draw conclusions and better display data and highlight findings. This is under sql_challenge_data_analysis.sql.

All data used for creating data tables are stored in the "data" folder.
